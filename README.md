This project is an introduction to security in the web domain which aims to familiarise begginer programmers with common vulnerabilities.

The task is to perform an audit of a website containing these vulnerabilities using a Virtual Machine, which runs an image that serves the website. The ISO image is supplied with the project resources.

Once you've configured the environment, launching the VM will return a simple prompt with an IP address. Access the website via a browser by navigating to the displayed IP address. This IP address can change between instances, and will be referred to as `0.0.0.0` in the project explanations.
