## Web Scraping

### Vulnerability:

Scraping is an automated threat that uses bots or web crawlers to extract data or output from a web application, assess navigable paths, read parameter values, perform reverse engineering, learn about application operations, and more.

With web scraping, business competitors can replicate your entire website—including HTML code and database storage—and save it locally for data analysis.

### Avoidance:

To avoid scraping attakcs monitor logs and traffic patterns and limit access if you see unusual activity.

Only allow users (and scrapers) to perform a limited number of actions in a certain time - for example, only allow a few searches per second from any specific IP address or user. This will slow down scrapers, and make them ineffective. You could also show a captcha if actions are completed too fast or faster than a real user would.

If you see unusual activity, such as many similar requests from a specific IP address, someone looking at an excessive number of pages or performing an unusual number of searches, you can prevent access, or show a captcha for subsequent requests.
